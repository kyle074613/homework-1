                My name is Kyle Jones! I am a student at UC Irvine looking pursuing a 
                career as a programmer. My relationship with computers goes back to the 
                early days of my childhood. I was always using the family computer when 
                I was a kid - so much so that my mom had to put a time limit on my computer
                usage! This love for computers has only grown stronger as I've grown up, and 
                learning more about them is a passion of mine. It is this passion that has led me 
                on the path to become a professional programmer.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have studied computer science in pursuit of my passion for computers. I recieved an
                Associate's Degree in computer science in 2018 from Irvine Valley College. I really enjoyed 
                learning the different languages during the program. Sadly, the program only covered the basics 
                of a lot of the languages. I was left with a desire to learn more after I had graduated, thus I 
                joined the UC Irvine Coding Bootcamp to hone my skills, learn more coding languages, and hopefully 
                set me on the path to become a professional programmer!

                On a more personal note, I love dogs. Back in 2014, I adopted my first ever dog, Harley.
                She was just two months old when I got her and we have been inseparable since. I think
                she is part Jack Russell Terrier and part Chihuahua, but I do not know for sure. Aside from  
                my dog, I love playing video games, playing guitar, and hanging out with my friends.
