# homework-1

This project is a website for my portfolio works. As of now, there are no actual works to show, but this is a demonstration of a website with multiple pages styled using CSS. There is an index page, a page with my portfolio works (only placeholders as of now), and a page to contact me (does not work as of now, just a styled web page).


## Usage

There is no installation required! All you need to do is go to kyle074613.github.io/homework-1. This will take you to the index page (About Me page). All the other pages can be accessed using the navigation links in the upper right corner. "Portfolio" will take you to the page with my portfolio works, "Contact" will take you to the page to contact me, and "About" will take you back to the index page. If you desire, you can download all the files in this project to view the web page on your computer locally. The CSS file is located in the assets/css folder.


## Credits

Special thanks to w3schools.com for all their CSS styling tutorials!
